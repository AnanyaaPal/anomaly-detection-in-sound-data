# Interpretable Anomaly Detection in Sound Data

A variety of industrial applications require explainable anomaly detection algorithms. This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive comparison of the already established algorithms from a variety of domains in the field (Deep Learning ~ Autoencoder, Quantile-Quantile Differences ~ Statistical Algo ~ Sound Spectogram) and the latest algorithm, namely, an Isolation Forest (~Supervised Learning). 

## Goal of the project
To provide practical recommendations for interpretable anomaly detection, based on systematic benchmarking.
